# Qr_Authorisation
In today's modern world we need to protect ourselves or our organization from any kind of theft be it online or offline,
So in order to achieve this we can qr_codes authorizaton as we know there are so many malicious qr_codes which when we scan can lead us to 
any website so,this qr_authorisation can be used to detect whether a qr scanner a qr_code is right or not 
Its application include:
        1. Identifying the employees in a firm.
        2. Document verification 
        3. Attending some events (as we have the data of the person we can check it with the qr_code that the person will be bringing).
        4. Giving access to a place where authorisation is limited to few person and so on.
